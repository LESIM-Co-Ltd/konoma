# Changelog

All notable changes to konoma are documented in this file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- Editor-style git change gutter in code/text previews (Zed/VS Code style): a
  one-cell marker to the left of the line-number column shows added, modified,
  and deleted lines at a glance. Distinct from the full-screen `d` diff view.
  Green `▌` marks added lines, amber `▌` modified lines, and a red `▔` sits on
  the top edge of the line just below a removed block, so a deletion reads as
  "removed between these rows" without disturbing line spacing. A deletion that
  is contiguous with an add/modify folds into the modified marker (matching Zed).
- `[ui] git_gutter` config option (default `true`) to toggle the gutter. Files
  with no changes and non-repositories keep their previous layout unchanged.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- Inline image preview inside Markdown: block-level images (Markdown `![](…)` and
  HTML `<img>`) render in the flow of the document via kitty graphics, decoded off
  the UI thread. A dim `🖼 alt` placeholder reserves the space until the image is ready.
- Remote images: `http(s)://` images are downloaded with the system `curl` into an
  on-disk cache (`~/.cache/konoma/remote-images`) and then rendered like local files —
  the kind of screenshots and badges READMEs show on GitHub. SVG badges/logos are
  rasterized with resvg. A `loading…` line shows while fetching; unreachable hosts,
  non-image responses, and missing files degrade to a text placeholder (principle #3).
- Partially-scrolled inline images are drawn clipped to the viewport (their visible
  band is cropped and encoded) instead of being hidden, so large/stacked images stay
  visible while scrolling.
- `samples/images.md` demonstrating local, HTML, remote, and fallback cases.

### Changed
- Inline-image encoding (resize + protocol) runs on a dedicated worker thread, so the
  UI never blocks while an image is prepared or re-clipped during scrolling.

## [0.1.1]

### Added
- Prebuilt binaries for macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel) and Linux (`x86_64`) attached
  to each GitHub Release, with `cargo binstall konoma` support.
- CI verifies builds on Linux and Windows in addition to macOS.

### Notes
- Windows is intentionally not built: konoma uses Unix-only standard-library APIs,
  and Windows terminals lack the kitty graphics protocol the previews rely on.
- Linux support is experimental — it builds in CI, but its runtime (previews,
  clipboard, trash) is not yet verified.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

### Added
- Tree view and full-screen preview with mode transitions (Tree ⇄ Preview), and a
  safe `[can not preview]` fallback for unsupported formats.
- Config-driven preview delegation (built-in renderers or external commands).
- Full-screen image preview via the kitty graphics protocol with zoom/pan, GIF
  animation, and SVG rendering.
- Markdown / Mermaid rendering and syntax-highlighted code preview.
- Video thumbnails (representative frame; no in-terminal playback) and multi-page
  PDF preview (one page at a time; `J`/`K` to navigate).
- In-app git suite: status, diff, log, a custom commit-graph renderer, branches,
  and commits.
- File manager: create / rename / delete (trash by default) / copy / move, plus
  search, bookmarks, and sorting, with confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
- Tabs, path copy, a fully configurable keymap with conflict detection, and an
  optional quit-confirmation dialog.
